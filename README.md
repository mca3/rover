# rover search engine

Named after a certain dog in Windows XP.
**Under development, don't use.** Yet, anyway.

rover is a lightweight moderated search engine for personal websites.
It was written as a way to better find small websites and for people to post
theirs for discoverability.
I know <https://wiby.me> exists, but the setup for it seemed convoluted and I
wanted to try my hand at a search engine anyway.

## crawl.py

crawl.py is the website crawler; unfortunately written in Python, but
BeautifulSoup is the gold standard for web scraping, or so I'm told.
